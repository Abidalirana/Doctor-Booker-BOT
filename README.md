## üß† Step 4: Hugging Face (Gradio) Code

Paste this in your Hugging Face Space (Python file):

```python
import requests
import gradio as gr

WEBHOOK_URL = "https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/exec"  # Replace with your actual URL

def clinic_bot(full_name, phone, age, symptoms, appointment_date, email):
    data = {
        "full_name": full_name,
        "phone": phone,
        "age": age,
        "symptoms": symptoms,
        "appointment_date": appointment_date,
        "email": email,
    }

    # Send POST request to Google Apps Script
    try:
        response = requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, data=data)
        msg = f"Thank you {full_name}!\n\nYour appointment request has been received.\n"
        msg += f"phone: {phone}\nage: {age}\nsymptoms: {symptoms}\n"
        msg += f"appointment date: {appointment_date}\n"
        if email:
            msg += f"confirmation will be sent to: {email}\n"
        msg += "\nWe will contact you shortly!"
        return msg
    except:
        return "Something went wrong while submitting your form."

# Gradio Interface
interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=clinic_bot,
    inputs=[
        gr.Textbox(label="full name"),
        gr.Textbox(label="phone number"),
        gr.Textbox(label="age"),
        gr.Textbox(label="symptoms"),
        gr.Textbox(label="appointment date (e.g., 12 May 2025)"),
        gr.Textbox(label="email (optional)")
    ],

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

* **Problem:** `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendRow')`

  * **Fix:** Check that you're using `SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()` and sheet is open

* **Problem:** Data not reaching sheet

  * **Fix:** Make sure Web App is deployed and `Who has access` is set to `Anyone`

* **Problem:** Fields not saving properly

  * **Fix:** Match names exactly. `full_name` in both script and Python.

## üßæ Notes

* Field names are **case-sensitive** (use lowercase consistently).
* You can connect multiple sheets by changing the `openById()` method instead of `getActiveSpreadsheet()`.

If you need multi-sheet examples, just ask. ‚úÖ
